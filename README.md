## SPOTIFY_HITSONGS



The global recorded music market grew by 7.4% in 2020, the sixth consecutive year of growth, according to IFPI, the organization that represents the recorded music industry worldwide. The value of the market has been estimated to be $21.6 billion. It is hard to get a hint of how many songs an artist releases in a specific time frame but, given the fact that generally a viral song is very much less frequent than a not viral one, knowing if a specific song will be popular would give a hedge to producers and boost even more the revenues. In the current study, the problem of predicting whether a song would become a hit or non-hit was addressed using the main objective features of a song such as acousticness, tempo and danceability. A dataset of approximately 12.500 songs was created retrieving for each one the features from the Spotify Web API. After learning about the dataset through exploratory data analysis and clustering, the success of a song was able to be predicted with approximately 91% accuracy on the test set for the best model. The most successful models were the logistic regression and the tree random forest. The model that performed very poorly was the quadratic linear discriminant.
